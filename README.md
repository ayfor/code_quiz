# Code Quiz README

This application allows a user to complete a timed multiple choice quiz. When the user enters a question correctly a score of 10 points is added to their total score and when the user answers a question incorrectly, time is subtracted from the quiz timer. 
If the timer runs out completely, the quiz ends. When the quiz ends the user is able to enter their name. Their name is then posted to the list of high scores along with the score they achieved. The user may visit the list of high scores at any point when using the quiz application by clicking the list in the upper left-hand corner of the screen. High score entries are saved in local storage so they remain intact even if the user navigates away from the page without clearing their cache.
